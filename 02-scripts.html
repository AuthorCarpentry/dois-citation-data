<h1>Metadata associated with DOIs</h1>

<hr />

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Determine metadata associated with DOIs</li>
<li>Apply content negotiation commands to obtain a citation for a given DOI in a preferred style (e.g. BibTeX  or APA) from the CrossRef API</li>
<li>Gain experience with Bash command line tools to concatenate the citations into a single BibTeX publication list for reuse</li>
</ul>

<h2>Module 1C. Discover the rich Metadata associated with DOIs</h2>

<hr />

<p>When works are registered with DOI Registration Agencies, the Registrant
(publisher, data center, or other information provider) is required to submit
metadata about the resource that the DOI links to. Each Registration Agency
maintains its own metadata schema and establishes rules for requiring and
populating the metadata elements so it is important to check their respective
websites for a list of metadata elements used and whether they are mandatory or
optional.</p>

<p>Each Registration Agency also has the option of offering metadata look up and
harvesting services that researchers may openly query. At a minimum, these
services provide a basic citation for each DOI-assigned work: creator, title,
publisher, publication year, and URL for the landing page of the resource.
Additional metadata may include references cited in the work; funding sources;
author ORCiD numbers; usage licenses attached to the work; and more.</p>

<p>Researchers may search for metadata associated with DOIs in various ways. This
module demonstrates how to use the API services of two Registration Agencies &ndash;
CrossRef and DataCite &ndash; to query and retrieve valuable metadata about research
outputs. The commands demonstrated use the process of DOI Content Negotiation
to retrieve different representations of a work from the API service.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1C(1). Query the Registration Agency API to retrieve a citation</h3>

<p>for a published article</p>

<p><code>$ curl
http://api.crossref.org/works/http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102
&gt; cite1.txt</code></p>

<p><code>$ less cite1.txt</code></p>

<p>The retrieved citation is in JSON format &ndash; a popular way for presenting
citation metadata that can be parsed by machines. But what if you need a
different citation format for your purposes? Let&rsquo;s try Content Negotation to
specify that we want the citation provided in BibTeX, a citation format used in
many research information systems.</p>

<p><code>$ curl -LH &quot;Accept:text/bibliography; style=bibtex&quot;
http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102 &gt; cite1.bib | cat cite1.bib
|tr ',' '\012'</code></p>

<p>Do you know of any research information services that automatically ingest
citations in BibTeX? <strong>(Cue the ORCiD system) Keep this citation in its BibTeX
for Lessons 2 and 3, where we add it to a publications list to cite in a new
research paper.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2>Module 1D. How do I get a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for my material?</h2>

<hr />

<p>You have a few options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the services of an existing Registrant, such as a Publisher, Library, or
Data Center who is assisting you with disseminating and preserving your
research outputs.</li>
<li>Submit your work to an open research sharing system such as Zenodo who issues
DOIs as part of their free services to researchers.</li>
<li>Alternatively, your organization can join a DOI Registration Agency (RA) and
become a DOI Registrant. This commitment requires an investment of time,
infrastructure, funds, and human resources to ensure that registered DOIs are
maintained and revised as content changes or moves. Information about becoming
a DOI registration is available from the DOI Foundation.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that Zenodo does offer an API service which can be used via Python with
the Requests package installed. Advanced registration with Zenodo is necessary
to obtain a authorization token to include in requests.</p>

<h3>Exercise 1D(1). Quick field trip to Zenodo to explore its services</h3>

<p>Point your web browser to Zenodo:</p>

<pre><code>http://zenodo.org
</code></pre>

<p>Search or browse for the many different types of research resources deposited
it for sharing. Are you surprised by the many different types of objects being
deposited and assigned DOIs?</p>

<h3>Grande Finale! Exercise 1D(2). Retrieve a list of work types that are</h3>

<p>assigned DOI&rsquo;s by DataCite</p>

<p>This exercise applies various UNIX commands to answer the question &ldquo;What types
of works can be assigned DataCite DOI&rsquo;s and how many types?&rdquo;</p>

<p><code>$ curl https://api.datacite.org/work-types &gt; works_raw.txt</code>
<code>$ head works_raw.txt</code>
<code>$ cat works_raw.txt | tr ',' '\012' &gt; works_clean.txt</code>
<code>$ cat works_clean.txt | grep &quot;title&quot; | cut -d : -f 3 &gt; works_final.txt</code>
<code>$ cat works_final.txt | wc -l</code></p>
