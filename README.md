## Learning Objectives:

* Recognize the essential role of Digital Object Identifiers for the scholarly web
* List reasons to use DOIs 
* Identify components of a DOI
* Apply basic curl commands to test and resolve DOIs for research objects
* Explain how the DOI registration system is organized and what information it yields for authors
* Register a DOI for a scholarly work using an open repository
* Create appropriate metadata to describe a new work
* Retrieve the metadata associated with a DOI
* Apply content negotiation commands to obtain a citation for a given DOI in a preferred style (e.g. BibTeX  or APA) from the CrossRef API 
* Gain experience with Bash command line tools to concatenate the citations into a single BibTeX publication list for reuse

2. [Register a DOI](01-register-doi.html)
3. [DOI Metadata](02-doi-metadata.html)

## Requirements

Author Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use
their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient
workflow.

You should have a list of publications (with DOIs) and a scholarly object (like
a presentation, data set, report, or photo) that you are willing to share in an
open repository.

This lesson requires basic familiarity with the bash shell, simmilar to the
experience gained through the 
[Software Carpentry shell lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/).
You'll need to have a bash shell installed, you can follow 
[these instructions](https://swcarpentry.github.io/workshop-template/#setup).
