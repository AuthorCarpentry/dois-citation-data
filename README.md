## Learning Objectives:

- Resolve a valid Digital Object Identifier to an online landing page to
  determine what information is returned
- Test an invalid Digital Object Identifier (a DOI-like string) to determine
  what information is returned
- Use the DOI resolution system to determine which Registration Agency
  maintains a given DOI
- Determine open access availability of a digital resource using DOAI system vs
  the DOI resolver (is there an open license associated with this resource? And
where does the open version reside if not deposited in CrossRef?)
- Identify the components of a Digital Object Identifier and how they are
  assigned
- Gain experience with the UNIX curl command to obtain information from the API
  services of CrossRef and DataCite DOI Registration Agencies
- Obtain a DOI for a research contribution from a DOI member organization such 
- Obtaining Open Citations with BibTeX and JSON to produce an open publications
  list
- Parse into human readable form the citation metadata for a valid DOI returned
  in json format
- Apply content negotiation commands to a request from the CrossRef API to
  obtain a citation for a given DOI in BibTeX and APA Style
- Gain experience with UNIX command line tools to concatenate the citations
  into a single BibTeX publication list for use in various Research Information
Systems
